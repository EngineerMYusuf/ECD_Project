Pin roles:
  7th pin(Data1):     Data pin 1
  8th pin(Data2):     Data pin 2
  1st pin(My Ack):    Write: 0 means I am not done writing on the data pins, 1 means I am done changing the data pins.
                      Read: 0 means I am not done reading from the pins, 1 means I am done reading the pins.
  9th pin(Your Ack):  Write: 0 means you did not read the pins yet, 1 means you are done reading the pins.
                      Read: 0 means you are not done writing on the pins,1 means you are done writing on the pins.

Packet Structure:
  1st Byte: Start byte. Indicator of packet start. Always 255.
  2nd Byte: Source byte. Which node in the network originally sent this packet.
  3rd Byte: Data type byte. Does this packet hold temperature data or humidity data. Temp = 1, Hum /= 1.
  4th Byte: Data byte.
  
Methods:
  sendByte(int): sends the integer as its 8 bit binary representation 2 bit at a time. Then, asks for acknowledgment.
  ToDo: add My Ack to this function

  waitForAck():  Reads the 9th pin and waits in a loop until it is 1.
  readByte():    {waits until 9th pin is 1
                  reads 7th and 8th pin
                  adds it to "message"
                  writes 1 on 1st pin
                  waits until 9th pin is 0
                  writes 0 on 1st pin} <- does this 4 times to have 2x4=8 bits
                 return message


  ReadThread:    while (read = true){
                  Reads the first sent byte
                  {saves second read byte to bite2
                    saves third read byte to bite3
                    If data type is 1, parse it from 10000000 to 128 to 12.8  //Temperature is in XX.X format
                    Else, parse it as 10000000 to 128                         // Humidity is in XXX format
                  } <- If first byte read is 255
                 }
  OnClick():     Sets read to false to interrupt the ReadThread loop
                 Sends predefined bytes
                 Sets read to true
                 Calls ReadThread
